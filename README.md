# Countdown Timer with Minimum Remaining Time Threshold
JavaScript code implements a countdown timer that ensures there are always at least a specified number of minutes remaining until the end of the current hour. If the remaining time is less than the threshold, the timer automatically resets to the next hour with the specified remaining minutes.

Key Features:

    > Minimum Time Threshold: Ensures that there are always at least 7 minutes remaining until the end of the hour.

    > Dynamic Time Calculation: Continuously updates the remaining time every second.

    > Custom Time Testing: Allows for setting a custom time for testing purposes.

Functions:

    > countdownToNextHour(customTime = null): The main timer function that calculates and updates the remaining time until the next hour. It ensures the remaining time does not fall below the threshold.

    > localCountdown(now): Helper function to adjust the timer when the remaining time is below the threshold.

    > calculateRemainingTime(date): Calculates the remaining milliseconds until the next hour from a given date.

    > setTimeDom(timeRemaining): Updates the HTML elements with the remaining hours, minutes, and seconds.
